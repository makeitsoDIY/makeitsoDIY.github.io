title: Merry Christmas \(or merry whateveryoulike\[tm\]\)
---

This is where I wish all of you a merry christmas! Whether you celebrate Jesus's birthday, a reason to stay away from work or an excuse to buy overpriced toys 'n' gadgets (economy thanks you for your service) - enjoy the shit out of it!

I still didn't quiet finish packing for 34C3. But since I did finish wrapping all my gifts more than an hour before exchanging takes place, I consider this year's goal of reducing my habbit of procrastination achieved with success ;-)

Time to get stuffed like a turkey and lit like a tree to [some festive tunes](https://youtu.be/5-2VszpHHY0).
