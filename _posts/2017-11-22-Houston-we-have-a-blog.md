title: Houston, we have a blog!
---
Good morning, interwebz! I finally managed to set up a blog to document my builds and - for the sake of education or entertainment - my struggles and failures.
An occasional opinion or rant will also likely follow.


One of the reasons that led me to choosing GitHub to host this blog is the lightweight and static design, without the use of too many external ressources, i.e. scripts.
I therefore chose not to integrate disqus-comments or tracking, despite the template in use being capable. If you feel like interacting, please use one of the channels listed at the bottom of the page.
