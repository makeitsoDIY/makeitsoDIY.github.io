I am a citizen of the Web, based in Europe. As Crafter, Maker, Brewer, Gamer and Standard Nerd, I try to let my creativity flow as far as the (completely unrelated) day-job permits. This Blog, along with any Git-Repositories, is meant to document my struggles and results. An occasional opinion or rant might come its way, too ;-)

My main interests are:
* Everything related to the RasPi
* Gear for outdoor- bushcraft- an survival activities
* Brewing and related crafts
* Cosplay (since recently)

### IRL
Trained nurse, 83% through med-school, voluntering with the local FD and EMS.
Flaming advocate of a united Europe, next-door leftie.
