I am a citizen of the Web, based in Europe. As crafter, maker, brewer, gamer and standard nerd, I try to let my creativity flow as far as the (completely unrelated) day-job permits. This Blog, along with any git-repositories, is meant to document my struggles and results. An occasional opinion or rant might come its way, too ;-)

My main interests are:
* Everything related to the RasPi
* Gear for outdoor- bushcraft- an survival activities
* Brewing and related crafts
* Cosplay (since recently)

### IRL
Trained nurse, 83% through med-school, voluntering with the local FD and EMS.
